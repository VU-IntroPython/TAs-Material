    "## <span style=\"color:#4169E1\">What is `class inheritance`?</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "[`Class Inheritance`][c] is one of the core concepts of OOP that allows us to establish a type of `\"is-a\"` relationship **between classes**. It enables us to create a **new class**, known as the `derived class` or `child class`, that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class, known as the `base class` or `parent class`. Think of it as a **family tree** where the child (derived class) **inherits traits (attributes or methods)** from their parent (base class), **but can also have its own unique characteristics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is Class Inheritance Useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Real-world Relationships:** Inheritance mirrors real-life relationships and hierarchies, making our programs intuitively easier to design and understand.\n",
    "2) **Code Reusability:** With inheritance, we can write a class once and then extend it in other classes. This reduces duplication and errors, making our codebase more robust and maintainable.\n",
    "3) **Transitivity:** Just like in a family tree, if a class B inherits from class A, all subclasses of B will automatically inherit from A as well. This chain can continue, forming a multi-level hierarchy.\n",
    "4) **Simple and Understandable Model:** Inheritance helps organize complex systems into hierarchies that are simpler to manage and extend.\n",
    "5) **Cost Efficiency:** By reusing code and simplifying extensions, inheritance can significantly cut down on development and maintenance costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds fun, righ? Let's see how we can implement `class inheritance` in Python.\n",

By calling `super()`, `Cat` ensures that it starts its \"life\" equipped with **all** the `attributes` and `methods` that define a `Mammal`. It's like saying, \"Hey, I may be a cat, but I’m a mammal first!\" This way, all the essential characteristics like `name`, `age`, and `habitat` are initialized just as they are for any mammal, making sure that our Cat isn’t missing out on any family traits.\n",

    "Let's practice! Mind that each exercise is designed with multiple levels to help you progressively build your skills. <span style=\"color:darkorange;\"><strong>Level 1</strong></span> is the foundational level, designed to be straightforward so that everyone can successfully complete it. In <span style=\"color:darkorange;\"><strong>Level 2</strong></span>, we step it up a notch, expecting you to use more complex concepts or combine them in new ways. Finally, in <span style=\"color:darkorange;\"><strong>Level 3</strong></span>, we get closest to exam level questions, but we may use some concepts that are not covered in this notebook. However, in programming, you often encounter situations where you’re unsure how to proceed. Fortunately, you can often solve these problems by starting to work on them and figuring things out as you go. Practicing this skill is extremely helpful, so we highly recommend completing these exercises.\n",
