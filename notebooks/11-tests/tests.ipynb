    "Let’s break down the above code step-by-step:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. First, we imported the `unittest` library, which is a built-in Python module designed for testing. The `unittest` unit testing framework provides us with tools and methods that make it easier to check if the functions work as expected.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. Next, we defined a function called `add()`. This function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are both expected to be integers. The function simply adds these two numbers together and returns the result. For example, if someone called `add(2, 3)`, it returns `5`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. Then, a **test case** was set up. A `test case` is a single unit of testing that checks specific functionalities. By creating a class called `TestAddFunction` that inherited from `unittest.TestCase`, the code could use various testing methods provided by the `unittest` framework.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. The first test was used to check if the `add` function worked correctly when adding two **positive numbers**. Inside this method, `self.assertEqual(...)` was used to assert that the result of `add(2, 3)` should be equal to `5`. If that was the case, the test **passed**; if not, it **failed**.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. Next, another test, `test_add_negative_numbers`, checked if the `add` function could handle negative numbers correctly. We asserted that `add(-1, -1)` should equal `-2`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "6. Finally, we called `unittest.main()` to run the tests. The parameters `argv=['']` prevented the script from interpreting any command-line arguments, and `exit=False` kept the script from shutting down after the tests ran, which was necessary since we were running it from a Jupytdetail later.\r\n"
