Finally, in <span style=\"color:darkorange;\"><strong>Level 3</strong></span>, we get closest to exam level questions, but we may use some concepts that are not covered in this notebook.

Use a [counter][counter] and a `for` loop to perform the counting. Make sure your program is case-insensitive, counting both lower and upper case vowels.
