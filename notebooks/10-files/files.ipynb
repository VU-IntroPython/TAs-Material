    "This isn’t quite what we expected, is it? The function seems to return something called a `_io.TextIOWrapper` object. This happens because when we try to open a file, we’re really asking the **operating system (OS)** to locate the file by its name and ensure it exists. We use Python’s built-in `open()` function to do this. If the `open()` function is successful, the operating system returns a **file handle**, which in this case is the `_io.TextIOWrapper` object. The file handle isn’t the actual data, but rather an intermediary that allows us to read from or write to the file.\n",
