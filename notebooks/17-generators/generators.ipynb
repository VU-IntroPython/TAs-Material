    "`Generators` are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to iterate over data efficiently **without** taking up unnecessary memory. Unlike lists, which hoard all their elements in memory, `generators` produce items **one by one**, as needed. This technique, called `\"lazy evaluation\"`, makes generators incredibly efficient when working with **large datasets**. Think of generators as the chefs of the programming world—they prepare each dish just in time, saving resources compared to preparing everything in advance."

    "\n",
    "1) **Creating a Generator Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions use the `yield` keyword to return values **one at a time**. Every time `yield` is encountered, the **state** of the function is preserved, making it ideal for producing a** series of values** without storing them all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Generator Expressions:**\n",
    "These are similar to `list comprehensions` but use **parentheses** instead of square brackets. Generator expressions offer a concise way to build generators in **one line** — think of them as the compact sports car compared to the family minivan of list comprehensions.\n"
