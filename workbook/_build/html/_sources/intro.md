# Programming Workbook XB-0082

Welcome to the VU Bachelorâ€™s course, Introduction to Python Programming (XB_0082) ðŸš€

Itâ€™s great that youâ€™ve taken your first step into the world of programming. This course will provide you with the knowledge and skills to form a good foundation for your studies and, eventually, your career in the field. By the end, youâ€™ll have a clear understanding of the basics of the programming language, such as working with loops, handling exceptions, and understanding classes and methods.

This workbook is organised into eighteen chapters, each covering a specific topic. Weâ€™ve structured each chapter with a theory section followed by a practical section, so you can learn the concepts first and then proceed to applying them. This setup also ensures that the theory remains accessible as a reference for later on in your studies.

Learning something new can be challenging at times; there might be moments when you feel stuck, with no clear way forward. Donâ€™t worry, this is a natural part of the learning process. We encourage you to take your time, experiment with the code, and donâ€™t be afraid to make mistakes, as thatâ€™s where true learning happens. And remember, youâ€™re not alone in thisâ€”reach out to your peers or TAs whenever you need support.

So, letâ€™s get started. Thereâ€™s a lot to learn, and weâ€™re excited to guide you along the way!
