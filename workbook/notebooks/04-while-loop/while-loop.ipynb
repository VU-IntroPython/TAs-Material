You continue applying these rules until the sequence reaches the number 1. Strangely, when you apply these rules, you always end up in the loop of 4, 2, and 1—at least, this has been the case for all numbers tested so far—something that mathematicians still don’t fully understand or have been able to prove for all possible starting numbers.\n",
